We should create a utlis which keeps all the utlity at one place which help us to use same logic all over the components

It help us to make our code more readable, modular ,reusable ,maintainble and testable

modularity:- breakdown code into meaningful pieces

it is always a good practice to clear eventlistner

Chunking
Code Splitting
Dynamic Bundling
Lazy Loading
On Demand Loading
Dynamic import

when we are loading components in Demand React try to suspend it

under fallback we can write JSX(under Suspense)

never try to Dynamic loac components inside other components
