we cannot a class based components without a render method
constructor are used for initialisation
we do not mutate state directly

constructor--> Render--> ComponentDidMount

ComponentDidMount is a best place to call API because we need to render the components first then update the components

Mounting has 2 phase
    - Render phase- constructor-Render
    - Commit phase-ComponentDidMount
