1. How do you create Nested Routes react-router-dom configuration?

->  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      children: [
      {
        path: "profile",
        element: <ProfileClass />,
      },
      ]

      ]

2. What is the order of life cycle methods in class based component?

-> constructor-> render-> mounting-> updating-> unmounting

3. Why do we use ComponentDidMount?

-> The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). 
   This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered

4. Why do we use super(props) in constructor?

-> props. In React, the constructor is called during component creation and before mounting. If you want to implement the constructor for a React 
   component, call the super(props) method before any other statement.Otherwise, this. props will be undefined in the constructor and create bugs   

5. Why can't we have the callback function of useEffect async?

-> Because React's useEffect hook expects a cleanup function returned from it which is called when the component unmounts. 
   Using an async function here will cause a bug as the cleanup function will never get called
