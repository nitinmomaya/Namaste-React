initialise the npm using npm init 

npm uses to manage packages for our app
react app powered by different package and those package comes under npm

npm install -D parcel {-D means installing parcel for dev dependency}

package-lock.json is an very important file lock the verision of the package to avoid production bugs and local machine bugs, never include
package-lock.json under .gitignore file

node_module is a database for npm

node_module should always be a part of .gitignore file

<!-- NOT A GOOD WAY TO ADD REACT IN THE FILE, because whenever react is updated we have to keep changing the cdn links to use react
        <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script> -->

    Best way:  npm install react
               npm install react-dom/ install and i is same

     to start app syntax: npx parcel entrypoint-filename

     npx means npm gets executed          

     never touch node_module,package.json

     module can import and export

     parcel is a bundlers

     Transitive dependency- dependency has other dependency
